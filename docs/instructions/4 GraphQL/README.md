# GraphQL

Now, you understand how to build Sentant definition files and you have a Reality2 Node running, and you are perhaps wondering how to bring these two together.  Well, wonder no more becaue this section teaches you about the Reality2 Node GraphQL API.

Before you embark on this, though, make sure you are conversant with what GraphQL actually is.  [GraphQL.org](https://graphql.org/) is a great place to go.

The reasons for using GraphQL for Reality2 are described in great detail on that web site.
