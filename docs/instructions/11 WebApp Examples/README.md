# WebApp Examples

This section will collate a few WebApp examples as learning tools.  As described in the previous section, the existing WebApp was created using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), with the framework [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and a library called [svelte-fomantic-ui](https://github.com/roycdaviesuoa/svelte-fomantic-ui).  The package management and compilation tool was [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).  This is what is going to be used here, but there are numerous alternatives.
