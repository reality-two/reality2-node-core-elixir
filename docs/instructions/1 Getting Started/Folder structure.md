# Folder structure

The main Reality2 folder contains several subfolders with code and examples.  These are:

- **apps**

  - The main Elixir code for the Reality2 Node.  Here, you can find the inbuilt plugins such as the Pathing Name System and Authentication, which are mostly stubs for later work.

- **cert**

  - Some useful code and information about creating your own certificates.

- **config**

  - More stuff related to the Elixir code for the Reality2 Node.  Don't change things in here unless you know what you are doing.

- **definitions**

  - Some (possibly out of date) graphql and yaml definitions for sentants.  The stuff in the python folder is more recent.

- **deps**

  - The dependencies for the Elixir code for the Reality2 Node.  These are built when you run `mix deps.get`

- **docs**

  - Automatically generated files documenting the Elixir code, and these files you are now reading.

- **logos**

  - Some possible logos.  Any graphic designers out there want to suggest something better, let me know.

- **node-red**

  - See the section on node-red.  Here is the definition file for a node-red demo.

- **python**

  - Python demos and example Sentant definition files.

- **SBC**

  - Some code related to Single Board Computers (such as the Unihiker).

- **web**

  - Link into the web pages for Sentants.

- **XR**

  - See the section on XR.  Presently working on a Godot-based visualiser.  Might also do one for ThreeJS and Unity.
