### Current Status (July, 2024)

Reality2 is still in early Beta.  That means it is not complete, has bugs, and is likely to change.  You have been warned.

That said, we value people like yourself who are willing to give this new technology a go.  You are crucial to the ongoing progress of this project, and you have the opportunity to steer development in directions that you are interested in through your feedback.

## So, what exactly is Reality2?

Reality2 is a framework for connecting digital things that is both intuitive for the end user and secure.

Think of it as a digital glue between disparate technologies that makes everything so easy to use, you'll wonder how you managed before (that's the goal anyway, but right now it's not quite there...)

One of the problems of digital technologies today is that ease-of-use is often hampered by the need for security checking, logging in, passwords and the like.  These are essential for deterring hackers, however, they impinge on the usability flow, sometimes making technologies so complex that they are no longer use-worthy.

A term that guides us is '[Calm Technology](https://calmtech.com/)'.  Another is '[Use-worthiness](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/The-Useworthiness-of-Robots-for-People-with-Eftring/1218ffe1e4b76b6e8d5b15ffa44581084a74cf38)'.

We are inspired by the positive visions of the future that you see in movies and inspiration videos from companies, where people interact naturally and intuitivly with the tools and technologies around them.  One example is '[A day made of glass](https://www.corning.com/worldwide/en/innovation/a-day-made-of-glass.html)' by Corning.

In these future worlds, people go about their day calmly and happily using gestures, natural communication and contextual information when dealing with complex devices, and it all just works seamlessly.  They never worry about privacy, and never seem to be negatively affected by advertisers or algorithms trying to sway their decisions - and they don't need to be.

That is the kind of world we'd like to live in, so we've set about building it.

## Theoretical framework

The theoretical framework for Reality2 is based around the concept of data being represented as unique pieces of information that have a defined existance in time and space, much like a real, physical 'thing'.

This is part of the Objects and Actors metaphor that is slowly replacing the Desktop metaphor.

Unlike information on the Internet, where an image, sound, video, text etc, is copied many times as it is sent from server to client around the network, a Reality2 document (or Entity) is unique, and can only be passed from one user to another, but not copied.

Further, each interaction is recorded, so the life history (or provenance) of a piece of information can be determined.

But all this lies in the future.  That is called Thurisaz, and there is a white-paper you can read if you are interested that brings together the fields of epistemology, scientific thinking, statistics and computer science to solve the problem of validation of value transactions between digital and human entities.

Thurisaz requires that Reality2 exists.  So, that is step 1.

## Technical framework

To build this brave new world, this Reality2, we have considered the technologies currently available, and the many protocols and interfaces that have come from a time when we were not so worried about security.

We have then contemplated how the entire software stack may be re-imagined to improve usability as well as maintain security (and even improve that too), but at the same time we realise that the core infrastructure is still necessary, such as base operating systems, network stack and some protocols.

### Our solution - Digital Agents

To achieve our vision, we theorize that we will need a global network of digital agents that can be running on any device, from tiny wearables to massive mainframes.  We don't know yet if we are right, but along the way, we will have fun, create many side products and tools, and just maybe, we might inspire people to create truly use-worthy and intuitive technologies.  Oh, and solve a really big and juicy problem related to transaction validation and provenance tracking.
