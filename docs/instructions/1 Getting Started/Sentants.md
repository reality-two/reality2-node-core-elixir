# Sentants

## Core Properties

Sentants are digital agents that have some additional properties:

#### Immutability

- A Sentant cannot be changed once it has been created.

#### Persistance

- A sentant persists from when it is created to when it is decommissioned.  It is live and active during that time.

#### Uniqueness

- Each Sentant is unique in the world, and can be found and interacted with directly by any other Sentant (as long as there is a network connecting them together).

#### Consistency

- No matter how you interact with a Sentant, the result will be consistent across all channels.

## Digital Agent Basic Properties

#### Programmable

- A Digital Agent can be set up to perform tasks for you - ie, it can be programmed.  Sentants can be programmed using Finite State Machines, and supports plugins so its capability can be extended.

#### Interactive

- Digital Agents can be interacted with.  In Reality2, this is through sending events to Sentants, and listening for Signals.  We use a GraphQL-like interface with queries, mutations and subscriptions.
